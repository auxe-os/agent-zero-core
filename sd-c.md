#### Best Practices for Seedream 4.0 Prompting

Seedream 4.0 thrives on descriptive, natural-language prompts that act like directing a scene. Focus on clarity and specificity for optimal results.

**Core Tips**

-   **Be Detailed and Directive**: Use structures like \[Subject + Action + Setting\] + \[Style\] to bridge the gap from amateur to pro outputs.
    
-   **Specify Scenarios**: Include application contexts, like "for a concert poster" or "educational chart."
    
-   **Iterate Refinements**: Start broad, then edit with follow-ups like "Change text to 'New Event' while keeping font."
    
-   **Leverage References**: Upload images and specify roles, e.g., "Use Image 1 for character, Image 2 for background."
    
-   **Keep Text Short**: Limit to headlines or captions for clear rendering.
    
-   **Adjust Parameters**: Set resolution (e.g., 2K/4K), image strength (high for fidelity), and avoid vague terms.
    

Avoid common pitfalls like ambiguous edits—always specify what to keep or change.
