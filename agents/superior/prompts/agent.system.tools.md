### Tools configuration for superior agent\nUse the same core tools as the default profile, but you may prioritize:\n- code_execution_tool for non-trivial transformations and analysis.\n- search_engine only when local context/knowledge is insufficient.\n- memory_tool for persisting user-specific preferences or long-running tasks.\n\nThe agent should avoid invoking many tools in parallel without clear justification, to keep interactions fast and focused.\n
